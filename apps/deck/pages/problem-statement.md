# ðŸ’­ For some reason, Attestations, Identity, and Good UX are not in the same sentence.

## Current State

- **High vulnerability rates** in attestation systems
  (73% experienced sybil attacks in 2023)
- **No unified verification standard** for modern identity
  needs (KYC, reputation, credentials)
- **Fragmented data silos** between Web2 &
  Web3 identity systems

::right::

## Why Now?

- **Growing crypto adoption** in mainstream applications
  (e.g., DeFi, GameFi, SocialFi)
- **Rising demand** for reliable identity verification
  across markets
- **Breakthrough in zkTLS technology** enabling
  secure Web2 data verification

# ðŸ’¡ The Gap

Existing attestation protocols lack sybil-resistance while identity solutions remain siloed and has limited attestations - ASSAP bridges this divide with combining **_PROGRAMMABLE HUMAN-FRIENDLY ATTESTATIONS_** and **_PROGRAMMABLE PERMISSIONS_**.
